# Vim Settings
*Have now moved over to nvim. You can find my repo for that at [github](https://github.com/SOlsson91/nvim)*

My personal development enviroment.
I use it for coding:
- C++
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- C#


To Setup, add symlinc between git folder and vim settings and vimrc:

ln -s ~/Documents/Code/vim/.vim ~/ .
